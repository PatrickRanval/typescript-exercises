#Uhhh... Welcome to TypeScript

If I am understanding correctly, TypeScript is essentially a layer on top of JavaScript that is designed to reign in eccentricities of JavaScript (particularly around vague typing) such that the executed code does not exhibit unexpected behaviors. 

It is my understanding that as it is compiled, TypeScript will be rendered as and executed as valid JavaScript.  Furthermore, it follows that all valid JavaScript that is rendered in TypeScript will behave the same way even if TypeScript identifies things it considers to be erroneous or "at risk".

The Exercises were not hard, but the TypeScript and JavaScript are so similar that it can be tedious to remember the syntax to use. I'm having to look just about everything up at this point. I think as I use TypeScript more that will come more natrually.
